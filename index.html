        <h2 class="heading">Make a Brewth in a Mug</h2>

        <p>To make a delicious Brewth in a mug, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
        <ul class="clearfix ingredients ingredients-5">
            <li class="ingredient">
                <img class="illustration" src="media/ingredient/mug.jpg" alt="Mug"/>
                <b>A good mug.</b>
                <span class="secondary detail">
                    Nothing ornamental or decorative – you're going for a no-frills, sturdy
                    receptacle which retains heat.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li class="ingredient">
                <img class="illustration" src="media/ingredient/tea-bag.jpg" alt="Tea bag"/>
                <b>A sensible tea bag.</b>
                <span class="secondary detail">
                    Leave your fancy tea elsewhere, the Brewth is made with &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
                    tea. Use the Greasy-Spoon Test: If you wouldn't find it in a greasy-spoon café,
                    you wouldn't find it in a Brewth.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li class="ingredient">
                <img class="illustration" src="media/ingredient/milk.jpg" alt="Milk"/>
                <b>Milk.</b>
                <span class="secondary detail">
                    That's cow's milk; soya milk is only acceptable if you have a lactose

                </span>
            </li>
            <li class="ingredient">
                <img class="illustration" src="media/ingredient/sugar.jpg" alt="Sugar"/>
                <b>Sugar (optional).</b>
                <span class="secondary detail">
                    White or brown is fine. This should also pass the Greasy-Spoon Test, so that's a
                    big no to both Muscovado and low-fat artificial sweeteners.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li class="ingredient">
                <img class="illustration" src="media/ingredient/kettle.jpg" alt="Kettle"/>
                <b>Water (and a kettle to boil it with).</b>
                <span class="secondary detail">
                    Don't forget to descale your kettle!
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>
                Empty your kettle of any water, even if it only boiled a couple of minutes ago –
                never re-boil. Fill the kettle with freshly drawn water and begin to boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optionally warm your mug with a swill of hot water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the tea bag in your mug, along with your sugar and a splash of milk. Don't
                over-milk your tea, half-an-inch in a regular mug should do it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the kettle has boiled, leave it until the water has settled and then pour into
                your mug (you know it's ready when the kettle gives off an audible sigh). You should
                pour the stream of water through the tea bag at this point. Resist the urge to stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                After about two minutes, give the Brewth a gentle stir. Now take a spoon and
                repeatedly dunk the bag into the brewing tea; it helps to use the side of the spoon
                to allow hot water to flow through the leaves in the bag. As Phil says:
                <q>
                    I'd emphasise gentle at this stage. we're looking to circulate and percolate
                    without any agitate.
                </q>
            </li>
            <li>
                After 30 seconds to a minute of dunking, leave the Brewth for the rest of the four
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give the Brewth a final stir and squeeze the bag against the side of the mug to
                reduce the amount of liquid lost. Dispose of the tea bag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before serving, give the Brewth a final Whirlpool Stir: Twist the spoon quickly
                around the edge of the mug until a vortex appears in the center. Don't worry if you
                spill a little, but you get kudos if you reach the lip of the mug without spilling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sit down and take a moment to appreciate the aroma of your Brewth. Enjoy.
            </li>

        <p>
            Nobody knows the exact time and date of the first Brewth, but we know it was discovered
            by <a href="https://github.com/philbooth">Phil Booth</a>. There are many similar brewing
            methods available, but the Brewth yields a consistency of quality unmatched by its
            rivals.
