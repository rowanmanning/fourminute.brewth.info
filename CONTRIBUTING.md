How To Contribute
=================

The Four-Minute Brewth website accepts contributions for the
following:

  - Spelling/grammar/technical mistakes
  - Browser-compatibility fixes
  - Clarification of instructions

We probably won't accept:

  - Changes to the brewing method. Create your own site for that :)
  - Changes to the design. Again, you can design your own stuff
  - Heavy refactoring of the code


Coding Guidelines
-----------------

1. Indent with four spaces. No tabs/two-space indentation. Also, no trailing whitespace please
2. Generally follow the style that is currently present in the code â€“ consistency is important
